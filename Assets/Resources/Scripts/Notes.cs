    // Fire mastery makes you good at clearing ice and other levels but bad at fire levels, fire levels drop mats you need.
    // Pick difficulty of level before entering, dying drops your gear (or hardcore mode).
    // 10 is basically max stat on everything, 10 on one stat or 7 one stat and 3 other... 11 or 12 are ultra rares.
    //can reroll the stats with mats.
